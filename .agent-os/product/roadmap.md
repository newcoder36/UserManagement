## Dependencies Overview

**Phase 1 → Phase 2:**
- Stable bot infrastructure required for advanced features
- NSE API integration must be robust before adding analysis layers

**Phase 2 → Phase 3:**
- ML models need validation before production deployment
- Analysis accuracy must meet minimum thresholds (>65% prediction accuracy)

**Cross-Phase Dependencies:**
- Database schema must support all planned features from Phase 1
- Logging and monitoring framework established early for ML model tracking

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- NSE API rate limiting → Implement smart caching and request batching
- ML model accuracy → Establish minimum performance thresholds and fallback rules
- Market data reliability → Multiple data source integration planned for Phase 3

**Business Risks:**
- User adoption → MVP validation with limited user group in Phase 1
- Regulatory compliance → Legal review scheduled before Phase 3 launch

## Success Metrics

**Phase 1:** 
- Bot uptime >95%
- Response time <3 seconds
- 10+ active users for testing

**Phase 2:**
- Analysis accuracy >65%
- User engagement >50% daily active
- Confidence scoring correlation >0.7

**Phase 3:**
